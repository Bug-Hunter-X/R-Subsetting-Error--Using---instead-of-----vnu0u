# R Subsetting Bug: = vs ==

This repository demonstrates a common error in R programming related to subsetting data frames.  The bug arises from incorrectly using the assignment operator `=` instead of the equality operator `==` when specifying a condition for subsetting.

The `bug.R` file contains the erroneous code.  The `bugSolution.R` file provides the corrected version.

This simple example highlights the importance of paying close attention to the operators used in R, especially when working with logical conditions.
